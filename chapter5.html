                <p>Gatsby’s Wealth:</p>
                <p>Gatsby is finally able to show the one he adores most his life’s accomplishment: his wealth. He reveals to Daisy his extraordinary life style, his assets, and his money. She is overwhelmed, even crying at the sight of his massive shirt collection. He tries his hardest to essentially convince her to leave Tom, that he has a secure fortune to support them, that they can finally be together. It is clear to Daisy that everything he has done is for her. The question on Daisy and Nick’s mind is the same: Can she really live up to the idealistic standard Gatsby has for her?/p>

                <p>Love vs. Obsession:<p>
                <p>As the plot progresses, it becomes increasingly evident that Jay and Daisy are no longer the people they were when they met. For 5 years, Gatsby has maintained an image of Daisy in his mind, one of perfection, beauty, grace, and compassion. He has idolized her to the point of flawlessness. Daisy, on the other hand, now has obligations. She is forced to live with her choices; her faltering marriage, her baby with Tom, her commitment to maintaining social status. She cannot run off with Gatsby as easily as she once could. This shows the divide between the two characters.</p>

                <p>Economic Boom:</p>
                <p>During this period in history, there was an incredible economic boom. Gatsby illustrates this when he shows her his mansion. Gatsby has served 5 years waiting for the opportunity to exhibit his grandiose to the one that matters most to him: Daisy. And after finally achieving this moment, he decides to go all out in this second chance first encounter. After touring his extravagant home, Gatsby shows his near humble bedroom, and the last example of the extent of his power. This proves to work as Daisy cries into the wealth, and Gatsby makes his impression. The bright imagery of Gatsby's multitude of clothing is only to further convince the audience. During the 1920s, professional dress and white-collar work increased, with more and more people (like Nick) moving to cities to try to get rich. According to the Lehman Brothers Collection at the Harvard Business School’s Baker Library, the demand for collar-attached shirts grew considerably, while the lone collar business experienced a decline. This shows that more and more people like Jay Gatsby began buying collared shirts in the 1920s, thus showing the reason for Gatsby’s enormous shirt collection. This is why Daisy is so emotionally overwhelmed at his expression of wealth.</p>
