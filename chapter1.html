                    <p>Tom &amp; Daisy</p>
                    <p>In Chapter 1 of The Great Gatsby one of the main conflicts that will be prevalent throughout the novel is that between Tom and Daisy Buchanan. The two, while husband and wife, are introduced and immediately are shown to have a difficult relationship. This is exemplified through things like Tom’s answering of the house phone during dinner because his mistress called. And while they put on a so-called “show” for people, it is evident that there are many issues that they have with one another.</p>

                    <h3 class="content-title">Themes</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>There are a few themes that exist throughout The Great Gatsby that are introduced in the first chapter, like the themes of control, racism, and the roles of women. The theme of control, while manifested in various forms later on, is originally presented in the form of the control that exists between Daisy and Tom.</p>
                    <p>Tom and Daisy play a sort of cat and mouse game that is ultimately similar to a game of chess played by two who are almost constantly mocking each other. This mocking comes in the form of things like Tom’s mistress calling in the presence of his wife and guests as well as the conversation Daisy has with Nick. This conversation shows the true wit of Daisy, as she brings him out on the balcony almost solely to make Tom wonder what it is that they were talking about. And, lo and behold, Tom does wonder and he questions her once she comes back in, only to receive answers that mock his beliefs of things like white supremacy.</p>

                    <p>East Egg &amp; West Egg</p>
                    <p>The immediate setting of The Great Gatsby is introduced as the two 'eggs' of East Egg and West Egg. While they are called as such due to their resemblence to eggs, their location and geography are modeled after real places. The East and West Eggs are actually modeled after the two North Shore villages of Kings Point and Sands Point. Fitzgerald modeled East and West Egg after these places as he had lived in the real-world version of his fictional West Egg in a house similar to Nick's that was also surrounded by the gaudiness similar to that which appeared in West Egg.</p>
