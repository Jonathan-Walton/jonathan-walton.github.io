Gatsby is utterly distraught at this, because everything he has worked for has been for her, and in turn, in vain. Nick leaves him to collect his thoughts. After contemplating the events combined with a revelation from the billboard, he is determined to find Myrtle's killer, eventually ending up at Gatsby's mansion. However, both Gatsby and Wilson are dead due to a murder-suicide caused by Wilson's rage. Nick takes a moment to grieve, pondering over Gatsby's final thoughts.</p>
