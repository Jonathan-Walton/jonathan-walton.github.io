<p>Chapter 2 of The Great Gatsby illustrates the darker side of the ‘Roaring 20’s’. This chapter covers Tom’s affair with Myrtle Wilson. Nick is taken to the City of Ashes where he is introduced to different illegal activities such as drug use, alcoholic beverages, and homosexuality. This chapter is relevant because it reveals the more ominous side of the "perfect" lives of the people of West & East Egg. For example, this chapter also covers Tom’s affair with Myrtle Wilson, showing the more manipulative side of Tom.</p>

                <p>Love is blind, but it doesn't always go both ways. </p>
                <p>Gatsby further proves his unwavering loyalty to Daisy by waiting outside till 4am for her. When Nick finds him hiding in the Buchanan's bushes, he says he is waiting in case Tom hurts Daisy or until Daisy signals for him. Although Nick overhears Daisy and Tom reconciling, he hides this fact from Gatsby for he is far too infatuated with the idea of her.</p>
